Through afterschool classes, we have taught over 2,500 K-8 students how to code at 16 schools in Los Angeles and Sacramento.\"\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t]\n};\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/pages/AboutPage/AboutPage.json\n// module id = 290\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\n\t\"header\": {\n\t\t\"image\": \"/images/headers/get_involved.jpg\",\n\t\t\"title\": \"Get Involved\",\n\t\t\"description\": \"Giving the gift of coding not only impacts the lives of the students involved, it has the potential to change the world.\"\n\t},\n\t\"donations\": {\n\t\t\"paragraphs\": {\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"Donate\",\n\t\t\t\"paragraphs\": [\n\t\t\t\t\"$x ensures 30 kids learn how to code.\",\n\t\t\t\t\"The Coding School is a 501c3 organization.
