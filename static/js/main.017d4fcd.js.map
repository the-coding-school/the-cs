Recognizing coding as the universal language of the 21st century, we believe coding education must be dynamic as we are not just training the next generation of coders but future leaders and problem solvers who will become CEOs, politicians, artists and scientific innovators. Thus, we are pushing the boundaries of traditional coding education, embracing a diverse set of approaches and programs to ensure all students, regardless of socioeconomic background, geographic location, or learning differences, develop the skills necessary to thrive and tackle the most pressing issues facing our world.\", \"Founded by a Brown undergrad in 2014, The Coding School consists of a teaching team of 120 computer science and engineering students from six universities in California who are passionate about teaching the next generation the power of computer science. Through afterschool classes, we have taught over 2,500 K-8 students how to code at 16 schools in Los Angeles and Sacramento.\"]\n\t  }]\n\t};\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 172 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _AboutPage = __webpack_require__(170);\n\t\n\tvar _AboutPage2 = _interopRequireDefault(_AboutPage);\n\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\n\texports.default = _AboutPage2.default;\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 173 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(1);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _PageHeader = __webpack_require__(22);\n\t\n\tvar _PageHeader2 = _interopRequireDefault(_PageHeader);\n\t\n\tvar _DonationsPanel = __webpack_require__(225);\n\t\n\tvar _DonationsPanel2 = _interopRequireDefault(_DonationsPanel);\n\t\n\t__webpack_require__(456);\n\t\n\tvar _DonatePageData = __webpack_require__(174);\n\t\n\tvar _DonatePageData2 = _interopRequireDefault(_DonatePageData);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\t\n\tfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\t\n\tfunction _possibleConstructorReturn(self, call) { if (!self) { throw new ReferenceError(\"this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called\"); } return call && (typeof call === \"object\" || typeof call === \"function\") ? call : self; }\n\t\n\tfunction _inherits(subClass, superClass) { if (typeof superClass !== \"function\" && superClass !== null) { throw new TypeError(\"Super expression must either be null or a function, not \" + typeof superClass); } subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass && superClass.prototype, { constructor: { value: subClass, enumerable: false, writable: true, configurable: true } }); if (superClass) Object.setPrototypeOf ?
