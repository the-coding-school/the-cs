Thus, we are pushing the boundaries of traditional coding education, embracing a diverse set of approaches and programs to ensure all students, regardless of socioeconomic background, geographic location, or learning differences, develop the skills necessary to thrive and tackle the most pressing issues facing our world.\",\n\t\t\t\t\"Founded by a Brown undergrad in 2014, The Coding School consists of a teaching team of 120 computer science and engineering students from six universities in California who are passionate about teaching the next generation the power of computer science. Through afterschool classes, we have taught over 2,500 K-8 students how to code at 16 schools in Los Angeles and Sacramento.\"\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t]\n};\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/pages/AboutPage/AboutPage.json\n// module id = 308\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\n\t\"header\": {\n\t\t\"title\": \"Donate\",\n\t\t\"description\": \"Giving the gift of coding not only impacts the lives of the students involved, it has the potential to change the world.\"\n\t}\n};\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/pages/DonatePage/DonatePage.json\n// module id = 309\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\n\t\"header\": {\n\t\t\"image\": \"/images/headers/get_involved.jpg\",\n\t\t\"title\": \"Get Involved\",\n\t\t\"description\": \"Giving the gift of coding not only impacts the lives of the students involved, it has the potential to change the world.\"\n\t},\n\t\"donations\": {\n\t\t\"paragraphs\": {\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"Donate\",\n\t\t\t\"paragraphs\": [\n\t\t\t\t\"$x ensures 30 kids learn how to code.\",\n\t\t\t\t\"The Coding School is a 501c3 organization.
