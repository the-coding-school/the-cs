    quote: "I wish I had learned coding earlier. In beginning college computer science courses you are thrown in and expected to know so much already. These kids we’re teaching now have a huge advantage -- they’ll have the solid foundation and ability to build their knowledge from the ground up -- helping them understand and learn so much more so much easier. The beneficial impact this [education at a young age] will have on them is immeasurable.",
