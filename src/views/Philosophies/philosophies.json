    "description": "It requires long-term, continuous commitment. We’ve developed a three-year curriculum to ensure that students aren’t just given a sneak peak into the exciting world of computer science but that they have the support and guidance to develop their coding skills with years of taught lessons."

    "description": "Often left out of discussions surrounding coding education, we’ve found students with learning differences not only flourish due to the introduction of coding, but their passion and dedication has a butterfly effect in improving their other academic subjects as well. We’re devoted to making sure these students have the same opportunities to learn how to code. In partnership with Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, we’ve created a pilot coding program designed for students with learning disabilities."

    "philosophy": "There is not a one-size-fits all to coding education.",
    "description": "Diverse approaches to coding education are necessary to achieve diversity in computer science. We are committed to developing innovative teaching styles and approaches to ensure no student is excluded or discouraged from learning how to code. That’s why we created codeConnects, an online platform that offers one-to-one coding instruction for underrepresented individuals that are often deterred from coding due a host of systemic educational factors."
