      description: "Kiera Peltz is a Gates-Cambridge Scholar, pursuing her masters in Political and Economic Sociology at the University of Cambridge. She is a graduate of Brown University, where she received her B.A. in Political Science and Happiness. One summer, while attending an international conference in Seliger, Russia, she met a group of Estonians, who spoke about the importance of early childhood coding, stating that it’s mandatory for every Estonian, starting at age seven, to learn how to code. Upon returning to the United States, Kiera began critically examining the education system and came to realize that while the world has changed drastically in the past 50 years, our country’s public K-12 curriculum has remained relatively unaltered. So she set out to fix the gap in the education system by creating The Coding School to ensure the next generation learns the language that has built – and will continue to build – the modern world.",
